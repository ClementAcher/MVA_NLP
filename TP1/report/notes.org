* Part 1

- With the limit on the number of validation samples, they all get from the same
  few labels. So that is pretty bad to evaluate the models.o

Things to do :
- [ ] Tweak the MFCCs parameters
- [ ] Grid search on the logisitic regressing
- [ ] Change architecture of the neural net
- [ ] Mean-Variance normalisation
- [ ] Augment the dataset with noise
- [ ] More samples
- [ ] Other models

** Notebook initial

3.6 - 39.4

** Tweak the MFCC

Using the default values found on https://python-speech-features.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
13.1 - 47.9
